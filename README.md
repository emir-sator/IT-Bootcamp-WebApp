# IT-Bootcamp-WebApp

Within the subject of Software Development I at the faculty, we had the obligation to work in a team on the development of a web application. 
Our application is called Web Management Service for IT Bootcamp, with the main goal of student records, their course applications, lecturer records, 
student group records for course classes, uploading learning documents, etc... More detailed information about the participation of members in functionality implementation can be found in the Excel file.

The technologies and languages used for my functionalities are C#, ASP .NET core, a little bit of JavaScript, MS SQL Server.

Notes:
   - Before starting the application, you need to type "update-database" in Package Manager Console and press enter. After that, a database will be created with test data. 

   - Newly registered user will take on the "Polaznik" role.
